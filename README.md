# Fireworks KYC PoV Solution

This repository contains a Python-based Proof of Value (PoV) solution for automating identity verification using Fireworks AI. The solution processes identity documents (e.g., passports and driver's licenses) to extract key information like name, date of birth, and document number, ensuring accuracy and scalability for KYC workflows.

---

## Features
- Utilizes Fireworks AIâ€™s `phi-3` vision-language model for accurate data extraction.
- Includes preprocessing steps like image quality validation for clarity, centering, and visibility.
- Adds logical checks for date reasonability (e.g., ages between 18-100, no future dates).
- Outputs confidence scores and validation results for enhanced transparency.
